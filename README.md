# Vulnerability-Scanner
Vulnerability scanners are used to bring to light security vulnerabilities in their
computer systems, networks, applications and procedures. This project aims to
explore a method that will enable the user to run a security check for their computer
systems and networks. It takes help from techniques like artificial neural networks,
other logics based on vulnerability and its pattern to help the user detect
vulnerabilities in their system so that they can look for ways to combat them.
